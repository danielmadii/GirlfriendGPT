## What is GirlfriendGPT?

**GirlfriendGPT** is a free, open-source Chrome extension that acts as your personal AI texting assistant on [WhatsApp Web](https://web.whatsapp.com). It reads incoming messages, learns your texting style from your real chat history, and writes replies that sound like you — not like a robot.

Works in **any language**. No backend. No data collection. Just paste your OpenAI API key and go.

> Perfect for: busy people, long-distance relationships, anyone who hates overthinking texts.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Learns your style** — upload a WhatsApp chat export (.txt) and it analyzes exactly how you write
- **Any language** — works in English, Spanish, French, Arabic, or whatever you text in
- **One chat only** — you pick one contact; it does nothing in any other chat
- **Draft mode** — writes the reply in the input box; you review before sending
- **Auto-Send toggle** — off by default; turn on only when you trust the output
- **Risk scoring** — every reply gets a `low / medium / high` risk score before sending
- **Safety Mode** — never auto-sends on sensitive topics (jealousy, money, "we need to talk", etc.)
- **No backend** — everything runs locally; only the reply prompt goes to OpenAI
- **Privacy first** — your chat export never leaves the browser; API key stored locally only

---

## 🚀 Installation

### Step 1 — Download

```bash
git clone https://github.com/danielmadii/GirlfriendGPT.git
```

Or download the ZIP from the [releases page](https://github.com/danielmadii/GirlfriendGPT/releases).

### Step 2 — Load in Chrome

1. Open Chrome → go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable **Developer Mode** (top-right toggle)
3. Click **Load unpacked**
4. Select the `GirlfriendGPT/` folder

The extension icon will appear in your toolbar.

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

### 1. Add your OpenAI API Key
- Click the extension icon → **⚙️ Settings**
- Paste your key in the **API Key** field
- Get a key at [platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
- Select model (GPT-4o recommended)
- Click **Save Settings**

> Your key is stored only in `chrome.storage.local` — it never touches any server except `api.openai.com`.

### 2. Set the Allowed Chat
- Open [web.whatsapp.com](https://web.whatsapp.com) and note the **exact name** shown at the top of the chat
- In the popup or settings, enter that name in **Allowed Chat**
- The extension does absolutely nothing in any other chat

### 3. Upload Your Chat Export (Recommended)

This teaches the AI how you actually write.

**Export from phone:**
- **iOS:** Chat → tap contact name → scroll down → Export Chat → Without Media
- **Android:** Chat → ⋮ → More → Export Chat → Without Media

**In Settings → Chat Export:**
1. Click the upload area and select your `.txt` file
2. Select which sender is you from the dropdown
3. Click **✨ Build Style Profile**

The extension extracts your style locally — only a short summary and ~15 example messages get sent to OpenAI per reply.

---

## 🧪 Testing Safely

1. **Keep Auto-Send OFF** (this is the default)
2. Open WhatsApp Web and go to the allowed chat
3. Have someone send you a message
4. Watch the extension draft a reply in the input box
5. Review it, edit if needed, send manually
6. Only enable Auto-Send after you're confident in the quality

---

## 🛡️ Safety Mode

When Safety Mode is ON, the extension will **never auto-send** if the incoming message contains sensitive keywords like:

`trust` · `jealous` · `lying` · `future` · `marriage` · `money` · `break up` · `we need to talk` · `serious` · and more

High-risk replies get flagged and only drafted — never auto-sent.

---

## 🔒 Privacy

- Your OpenAI API key is stored only in `chrome.storage.local`
- The WhatsApp chat export is **never** sent to any server
- Only sent to OpenAI per reply: the incoming message + last 10 messages of context + a style summary + ~15 example messages
- No analytics, no telemetry, no accounts

---

## 🔧 Updating WhatsApp Selectors

WhatsApp Web changes its internal class names frequently. If the extension stops detecting messages, open `src/content.js` and look for these functions:

| Function | What it finds |
|---|---|
| `getActiveChatTitle()` | Chat name in header |
| `getMessageListContainer()` | Message list element |
| `extractText(el)` | Text inside a message bubble |
| `getMessageInputElement()` | The reply input box |
| `clickSendButton()` | The send button |

To find the current selector: open WhatsApp Web → F12 → Elements → click the element → note its `data-testid` or structure.
